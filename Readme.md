# Welcome Jerry!

To run this application: 

1. Put your magic API key on line 9
2. Put your Solana wallet address where you want SOL sent to on line 18 in useState
so you dont have to paste it in which can be annoying especially while debugging
3. run `yarn install` and `yarn ios`
4. Click login to login with an email
5. Write down the solana address that is generated for you
6. Go to https://solfaucet.com/ paste in that address and click "devnet"
7. Go back to the app and click "Send"
8. Watch the logs and you will see the Buffer issue that I mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/magiclabs/magic-js/issues/269
